I was reading up on the [[https://github.com/ultralytics/ultralytics/issues/18027][recent Ultralytics GitHub Action compromise]] and I
stumbled upon [[https://blog.yossarian.net/2024/12/06/zizmor-ultralytics-injection][this great analysis of the situation]]. In it, [[https://github.com/woodruffw/zizmor][zizmor]] is introduced,
which is a static analysis tool for GitHub Actions.

I experimented with it a bit and I have to say it's working great. It correctly
identified misconfigured GitHub Actions on some repositories I was working
on. It's another tool that's worth having as part of your CI.

Another interesting resource about GitHub Actions and security is [[https://github.com/nikitastupin/pwnhub][pwnhub]], a
repository with writeups and information on various security issues around
Actions.
