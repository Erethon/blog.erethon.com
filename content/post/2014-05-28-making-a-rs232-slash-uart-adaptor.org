A couple of months ago I wanted to experiment with the serial console
of an old router I had laying around. Not wanting to buy a =UART= to
 =RS-232= adaptor, I decided to make one myself. After all, I had some
spare [[http://www.maximintegrated.com/en/products/interface/transceivers/MAX3232.html][MAX3232]] left over from a previous project (for which I still
haven't blogged).

I just followed the schematic provided by the datasheet and 15 minutes
of soldering later, this was the end result.

Gotta love these cute little perfboards!

I've tested it both with a RapPI and the aforementioned router and it
works great. I was able to get a serial console on the router using
the serial headers on the pcb. The manufacturer had even marked the
TX/RX pin holes, so there was no need for me to go [[http://www.devttys0.com/2012/11/reverse-engineering-serial-ports/][serial hunting]].

Now, I'm waiting for some FTDI FT232-RL chips to arrive to make a USB
adaptor instead of a RS-232 one. I know you can buy one on ebay for 3
bucks, but where is the fun in that?
