Three months ago I installed Kippo in a low end VPS of mine. About a
month after that, I got bored of manually checking kippo everyday so I
made a small script to automate the process. Fast forward another two
months and here we're.

In three months time, I had 122.487 bruteforce attempts from 339
different IPs. Of said attempts, 130 were successful on finding the
correct password(s).  I set up Kippo to accept two different
easy-to-guess passwords for the root account. People interacted with
the honeypot (as in logged in and tried to download files, etc) only
16 times out of those 130. The rest were just bots logging in and
logging out.

The first command every attacker runs after logging in is =w=,
followed by =cat /proc/cpuinfo=. Ten out of the sixteen attackers
logged out after seeing the results of =/proc/cpuinfo=. I guess people
know about Kippo and recognize it by =/proc/cpuinfo=. After noticing
that, I changed mine â€“ something I suggest everyone to do as Kippo by
default is easily identified.  There were a few hits where people
thought it's an actual server and not a honeypot and tried downloading
some of their tools. I disabled =wget= but made it look like it's
there, so it was funny seeing them figuring out why they can't
download their files.

Unfortunately, I haven't come across any new web shell; only some IRC
bots, so nothing interesting to post about there.

Of the 122.487 previously mentioned attempts, I've gathered 30.048
unique passwords (around 29.500 if you don't count extra whitespace)
and 8.525 usernames. I run both of the lists containing passwords and
usernames against pipal. By far (49.12%) the most used username is
root followed by test (0.8%).

For more details on both of the reports check my Kippo findings page.
