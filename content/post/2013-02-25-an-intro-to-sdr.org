For the past two months I've been reading about [[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software-defined_radio][SDR]] and everything
related to radio telecommunications. For those that don't know what
SDR is (and are too bored to click the previous link), Software
Defined Radio is a system that implements hardware subsystems of a
typical radio in software. People have been designing their own SDRs
with [[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fpga][FPGAs]] for quite some time now, but in the last year there has
been a huge "revolution". It turns out that a lot of cheap USB digital
TV tuners based on the Realtek RTL2832U chip can be tuned at a wide
range of frequencies.

For a list of supported devices you can check [[http://sdr.osmocom.org/trac/wiki/rtl-sdr][this page]]. I've bought
two devices to experiment with, one is an [[http://dx.com/p/mini-dvb-t-digital-tv-usb-2-0-dongle-with-fm-dab-remote-controller-92096][EzTV 645 using the FC0013
chip]], while the other one is using the Rafael Micro R820T chip (bought
it from ebay for about 8 euro). I mainly bought them to experiment
with [[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Automatic_dependent_surveillance-broadcast][ADS-B]] and NOAA weather satellites. Due to university assignments
I didn't have the time for the latter, but I've spent some mornings
watching airplanes taking on and off from a nearby airport. Other
interesting things to listen to are: [[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Air_traffic_control][ATC]], [[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Automatic_Terminal_Information_Service][ATIS]], [[http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFkk6rkCX40][pager traffic]], car
keyfobs and anything else that is above in your chip range. As
mentioned earlier, due to the lack of time, for the time being I've
only experimented with ADS-B traffic.

I've done all my testing in Windows 7 using [[http://sdrsharp.com/][SDR#]] and [[http://sdrsharp.com/index.php/a-simple-and-cheap-ads-b-receiver-using-rtl-sdr][ADSB#]] in
conjunction with [[http://www.virtualradarserver.co.uk/][Virtual Radar Server]]. So far, using the stock antenna
with both dongles, the one with the R820T is performing way better
than the FC0013 one. There is less noise and it's better at picking
signals from afar. Moreover, it has a better tuning range, although it
differs from dongle to dongle and it depends more or less on your
luck.

I live fairly close to an airport so I get a good signal of any plane
taking on or off. The maximum range I've achieved with the R820T
dongle and stock antenna (omnidirectional) is 28km. I've checked the
results I get against [[http://www.flightradar24.com/][flightradar24.com]] and they are spot on. One
feature of ADSB# I like is the ability to share your findings with
servers that accept ADS-B traffic, like contributing to
flightradar24.com.

I won't go in more details at the moment, since I'm tight on time, but
for those of you that are interested in getting a SDR capable dongle,
do some research first. Not all dongles have what is called an esd
protection diode. As its name implies, it's a diode (a passive
component allowing current to flow in one direction only, like a check
valve) that protects against electrostatic discharge. A lot of people
have "fried" their dongles because they didn't have aid diodes. By
leaving the antenna outside, the wind can create static charge on the
antenna and fry the chip inside the dongle. Both of my dongles came
with those diodes, but if you plan on buying one, read some comments
first or if buying from ebay ask the seller for a picture of the
dongle. The diodes are the ittle black things I've circled in red near
the antenna connector.

For those of you that want more info on ADS-B I suggest watching [[http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CXv1j3GbgLk][this
amazing talk]] by [[https://twitter.com/ihackedwhat][Render Man]] [[http://www.renderlab.net/][(http://www.renderlab.net)]].
