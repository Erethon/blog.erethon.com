I decided to reinvent the wheel by making an ARP spoofer in python
using raw packets, thinking it would be a nice practice.

What is [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Address_Resolution_Protocol][ARP]], [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ARP_spoofing][ARP spoofing/poisoning]], ARP cache?? How do they work and
why should we care? Since all of these things have been written and
explained before, in a better way than I could explain them, [[http://www.grc.com/nat/arp.htm/][here you go]].

You can find the script [[https://github.com/Erethon/ArPois.py][here]]. It's more like a proof of concept than a
fully working program, since I haven't really tested it in more than
two computers, so I don't know if it'll work for sure. Its purpose is
purely instructional. The script is licensed under the MIT license so
you are free to change/modify it to your heart's content.
