A long time ago, I saw [[http://hakshop.myshopify.com/products/throwing-star-lan-tap][this in the Hak5 store]]. After reading about it
in [[http://ossmann.blogspot.gr/2011/02/throwing-star-lan-tap.html][mossmann's blog]], I found somewhat interesting that using this
easily built device you can [[https://youtu.be/drJWxMLrpE0][HACK THE PLANET]].

An ethernet tap is a passive device used to monitor traffic between
two hosts using a third one. For more info on network taps read [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Network_tap][here]].

The idea behind it is very simple, but in order to understand it we
must first understand how data is transmitted through the ethernet
cable. The ethernet cable, commonly called [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Category_5_cable][Cat 5]] contains four pairs
of twisted wires. 100BASE-TX (fast ethernet) only uses two pairs of
these wires, one pair for transmitting data (TX) and one for receiving
(RX). So, in order to intercept the data sent from one of the hosts,
we just need to connect the host's TX line with our RX one. Likewise,
to intercept incoming data to the host, we need to connect the host's
RX line with our RX line.

Note that we can't connect both the host's TX and RX in the same RX
line, since fast ethernet is [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Full-duplex#Full-duplex][full duplex]]. To overcome this we need to
use two taps, one for the received data and one for the transmitted.

For more details on how to make one, read these two posts: [[http://www.enigmacurry.com/articles/building-an-ethernet-tap/][#1]] [[http://www.winsnort.com/index.php?module=Pages&func=display&pageid=8][#2]]

After a bit of soldering, this is what I ended up with.

The two ports near the euro coin are to be connected on the pc and the router,
while the other two ports are for intercepting the traffic. As stated
previously, one is for the transmitted data and the other for the received. To
use them both at once, you need either a pc with two network cards or an
ethernet to usb adapter.
