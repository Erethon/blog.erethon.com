I decided to port my blog to [[http://octopress.org/][Octopress]] and move away from Wordpress
after all these years. The reason for this is twofold:

- I've really gotten used to working with vim, git, github and the
  surrounding workflow.
- Static site generators are all the rage currently, so who am I to miss
  out?

Why Octopress and not something based on Python like [[http://docs.getpelican.com/en/3.3.0/][Pelican]] or
[[http://getnikola.com/][Nikola]]? I simply decided to do something that will get me out of my
comfort zone and also teach me something new. I already know how to
use venv, let's see what RVM has to offer.
