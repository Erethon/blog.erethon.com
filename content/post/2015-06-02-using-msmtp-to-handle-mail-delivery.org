Following the example of [[http://greg.kh.usesthis.com/][GKH]] and others, I've added one more piece of
software on [[http://blog.erethon.com/blog/2015/02/27/my-mail-setup-using-mutt-slash-offlineimap-slash-imapfilters/][my email setup and workflow]]. That piece is [[http://msmtp.sourceforge.net/][msmtp]], a very
simple and lightweight SMTP client, that integrates really well with
the rest of my setup.

At its core, msmtp does one thing. It gets mail from a MUA -in my case
mutt- and relays it to a remote SMTP server. Its strength lies in its
[[http://msmtp.sourceforge.net/doc/msmtprc.txt][configuration file]].  All of its options can be set per account, which
means, that it's easy to achieve complex tasks. E.g., you can have two
accounts use no proxy, a couple more use a remote machine through a
SOCKS proxy and a super private one [[http://msmtp.sourceforge.net/doc/msmtp.html#Using-msmtp-with-Tor][use TOR]].

Another thing I really like about it, is the "fine tuning" it allows
you to do in regards with TLS. It gives you the ability to [[http://msmtp.sourceforge.net/doc/msmtp.html#Transport-Layer-Security][pin TLS
certificates to each account]] or even set the minimum number of
Diffie-Hellman prime bits for TLS sessions.

There are also some scripts based on msmtp that allow you to queue
emails if you don't have internet access, e.g.Â when on a plane, review
them later on and send them once you're connected again.

All in all, if any of the above sound useful to you, give msmtp a
try. I promise you won't regret it.
